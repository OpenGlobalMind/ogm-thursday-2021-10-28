[00:00:00] Hi. 

[00:00:01] Hello, this... just waiting for my coffee to finish brewing. 

[00:00:07] Nice. What is your preferred technology? 

[00:00:13] For brewing coffee? 

[00:00:14] Yes, exactly.

[00:00:16] A Keurig or, well, this one's not a Keurig, but it operates the same way. You know, my Keurig broke and I've had a lot that have broken over the year. I drink a lot and I buy the different sizes, but this was so cheap I got online, and I said, even if it doesn't last, it's worth it to buy it. It was like under, under $40. And it's, it's just me. So it's lasted, and I'd rather buy a new, I mean, it's sad, 

[00:00:44] but that's great. Hey, 

[00:00:47] hello there, Leif from Sweden. Nice to see you on Thursday. Yes, this is great. 

[00:00:56] Um, the day of the, uh, uh, the God of thunderstorms, Tor, 

[00:01:03] uh, Tor, and what happens on the,

[00:01:06] what happens on the day of the God of thunder, thunderstorms? Is there a celebration, or do people go out on the streets and enjoy the rain or. 

[00:01:14] No, the thunderstorms. So a lot of sound, et cetera. It's coming from a, when Tor was driving his, uh, uh, car or carriage and made a lot of noise.

[00:01:29] Because he hadn't rounded the wheels properly.

[00:01:31] I mean, it was, was it poor design or was it just, was it just the mass of the chariot? It was just such a, 

[00:01:40] and the hammering on the 

[00:01:42] horses love that. Um, Hey Pete.

[00:01:53] Um, I haven't, I haven't met Leif. I don't know who you are.

[00:02:00] Who are you? 

[00:02:03] I'm Stacey. And I come here just to, just to see what's going on and what I could add to the conversation. So if I know who you are, then I know where I might be able to fit in better. 

[00:02:15] Well, I I'm intrigued by the mapping done, uh, by and through uh, Jerry.

[00:02:21] So, uh, I'm very excited to see what new maps might emerge from our conversation. It's triggering his mapping and my focus is on finding the positive maps of the future. 

[00:02:36] And I can help a little bit by showing you Leif in my brain. Uh, he, uh, in fact, uh, he was named, uh, brain of the year, a few years ago, uh, which is done by the brain trust charity, uh, and in the UK, uh, which is run by, I guess, by [[Person/Tony Buzan]].

[00:03:03] Yeah. Unfortunately he died uh one-and-a-half year ago. 

[00:03:09] Got it. And so Leif, here's the book on national intellectual capital, corporate longitude, what you need to know to navigate the knowledge economy from 2002. Uh, and he and Hank Kune, and I have been collaborating a lot on positive cartography, um, et cetera, et cetera.

[00:03:26] He's forming a thing called the new club of Paris or has formed, I guess, 2006, um, which is doing a bunch of interesting work, which is kind of based on the 1956 club Paris, uh, which was worried about renegotiating sovereign debt back in the day. Uh, and then I just went to Tor. Is that the right pronunciation?

[00:03:53] Um, Tor, Tor, the dude we call Thor. So, uh, and uh Donner is, uh thunder. The word for thunder in German is Donner, D O N N E R a and I et cetera. So it comes from four here's Thor from Marvel comics, which is part of the Marvel cinematic universe. Here's uh MCU and Stan Lee, uh, somewhere in here, I've got more, more of the superheroes.

[00:04:25] And then back to Thor, the element thorium is named after him. And then, uh, his equivalent over in Hindu mythology is Devendra or Indra. And then there's this and, and Indra is very interestingly sort of connected to Indra's net, which is one of the more ancient, motivating. I mean, if a lot of us are motivated by Vannevar Bush's essay or Doug Engelbart's mother of all demos, we should also be likewise motivated by Indra's net, which is this idea of a set of jewels set in a net where each jewel reflects all the other jewels.

[00:05:08] That's kind of this holographic vision of knowledge, um, of weaving a new fabric, almost like. Almost like, well, we're kind of aiming for this. Right. And so I have it. So I have it. I have all these different visions connected under, in a thought called visions that have inspired builders, uh, of global brains.

[00:05:30] Uh, so here's the Gla... the Magister Ludi, the glass bead game, uh, Engelbart's mother of all demos. Uh, Vannevar Bush's Memex, uh the Noosphere from Teilhard de Chardin. And this idea of rhizomes from, uh, Deleuze and Guattari Nelson, Atari, and Dolores, uh, that should be here as well. Wasn't it? What did I do?

[00:05:52] Uh, so Ted Nelson would be hypertext? What's my shortcut to Ted, um, uh, as sorry As We May Think, right. 

[00:06:03] As We **Will** Think is his version of that essay. 

[00:06:06] Oh, yeah. Let me go to Ted. Let me find the web there. Uh, yeah, exactly good point. Well, we'll, we'll put, 

[00:06:16] He's also got Computer Lib, right? 

[00:06:19] Computer lib, right? Exactly.

[00:06:22] Yeah, I think [[Possiplex]] is his best, most recent book for anyone looking to study his ideas. 

[00:06:29] Cool. Yeah. Eric and Eric, you've gone deep into [[Topic/ZigZag (software)]], which I'd love to hear about. Um... 

[00:06:36] and I've got a shrink wrap, shrink, wrapped copy of Computer Lib still. 

[00:06:40] Nice. 

[00:06:41] And why is Computer Lib not in in my Brain? That's weird.

[00:06:47] You have an unwrapped one that you've read? 

[00:06:50] Uh, yeah, there's one, that's actually in a box in storage at this point, but, uh, they tried selling them for a thousand bucks a book. Perfect. Wow. They should actually issue them as NFTs. That might actually, that's probably, it's a hundred now. They could probably fund Xanadu entirely from appreciation over time.

[00:07:13] Um, if anybody wants to find the best link for Computer Lib, I will add that to my brain and then add it to that thought because it's totally correct. What's interesting 

[00:07:21] about Computer Lib, there is a PDF version online that's illegal that Ted knows about. So if you could find the PDF version, you could read it, but uh you shouldn't 

[00:07:33] we could read it.

[00:07:37] Jerry, do we have any good map of the work from Douglas Engelbart? 

[00:07:42] Of course! 

[00:07:44] Sam 

[00:07:45] Hahn's the expert on that.

[00:07:48] Also, uh, 

[00:07:49] Eugene Eric Kim, who is a, a lovely friend of the network and who I haven't talked to about coming in and joining these conversations and should be great to have him. Yeah. Thanks Pete. For the computer lib dream machines link.

[00:08:07] That's perfect. So, um, welcome everybody. Uh, we are on the alternate week, which means, uh, let's find a topic to talk about, um, Eric in the calls channel online on meadow, on Mattermost I to remember three different things there, um, uh, mentioned that we could talk about what do we think of as success? And I asked her just seconds ago, I sort of wrote in, do you mean personally or do you mean for OGM, et cetera, because it's a, it's a lovely question.

[00:08:36] They're tied together. Okay, good. So the, the blend of them, I liked that. And then I was thinking of an interesting topic we could talk about, um, which is, um, Facebook has just declared the metaverse as the future of their company, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah. Um, I'd love just sort of opinions on the metaverse thing.

[00:08:55] That would be, that would be an interesting topic as well. Like, like what do we mean? What do we mean metaverse and is there a version of a metaverse that might actually be interesting and succeed, uh, et cetera. Cause I think that the conversation that Facebook's shining a big light on the metaverse has open is an opportunity for things that we care about, but that's, we could pick that, uh, any other topics anybody would like to put on the floor there being no actual for here, but 

[00:09:26] I got three, which is obviously too many, but let me just share them.

[00:09:29] One is that I've been reading David Graber's new book, the Dawn of. Yup. Uh, which is stunning and deeply important. Um, one reviewer compared to Galileo and Darwin, which I think is not a huge overreach. Uh, but maybe we wait until people have read that. So let me just throw that into the mix. Um, second, um, y'all just muttered about MFT NFTs when a conversation about NFTs and, um, value and bullshit and so forth.

[00:09:59] Um, and third, what was the third? It was just, just now, um, um, 

[00:10:05] um, crises. You can do it. It'll come to you. 

[00:10:09] Um, 

[00:10:13] I don't, I'm trying to reinstate the thought back in your brain, 

[00:10:16] the, my brain. It w it worked, oh, my, uh, my [[Resource/Living Between Worlds Webinar]] last week was focused on [[Topic/Critical Four Letter Words]]. We talked about "hope" and "fear.""

[00:10:30] Uh, we didn't get to "plan."" And I think it would actually be interesting to have a conversation here about plans and planning. This comes up because [[Person/Doug Carmichael]] and a couple of other people have said to me, so where the fuck is the climate plan? Why isn't there a plan, just this huge crisis, why isn't there a plan?

[00:10:48] And there are actually a lot of plans. There's a conversation to be had about plans and planning. And how do you plan in a mess, which is different than planning a project to build things. Uh, so that, that, that angle on it feels pretty OCME. So that would be my other, rephrase it and say, do, how do you make a map when you are in a yeah.

[00:11:11] And why, and why would you yeah, exactly. How do you navigate in a storm with no, And the people say, wait a minute, we need a plan. May not be the people to listen to at that point, but, you know, yeah. I thank you for the storm metaphor. My friend, Chauncey Bell is fierce about this. He, he, he decries, um, he decries the notions of problems and solving.

[00:11:36] So as soon as you say, problem, people think solution and solution is fine for discrete problems, but not for messes, uh, about a [[Ted Nelson]], intertwingled, complex, well, what we're in, where you cannot find discrete solutions. Everything's connected to everything else.

[00:11:55] You've got technical and social and political and you know, many different dimensions, uh, not conducive to neat and tidy plans. [[Person/Dwight Eisenhower]], not only twice president, but also the architect of the D-Day invasion, uh, is famous for saying, um, uh, planning is critically important planning. Uh, 

[00:12:18] so his quote is actually going to get it backwards.

[00:12:22] Well, yes. And a little bit off. So I said, plans are worthless. Planning is invaluable. And then I think it's a Winston. Yep. Winston says plans are a little important, but planning is essential probably with a cigar in his mouth 

[00:12:37] and a whiskey in his hand. Other hand. 

[00:12:39] Yeah. Yeah. He had a, he had a bedroom in the bunker where they did all the planning, uh, where he would wake up at, I don't know, 11 in the morning or something like that.

[00:12:49] He was hard to get up in the morning, um, done to get down to the bed. Yeah, exactly. No, he used to do a lot of calls and meetings. I think from bed, he has a strange character. One of the things I loved about binge watching the crown was the parts of it that involved Winston and just seeing. Seeing the drama dictation of a different angle on his life was really, really interesting.

[00:13:11] Okay. Uh, when I say where's the plan, I think what I meant was we have goals, but if there's not some statement of first steps, having a goal is totally useless and we have no concrete plan that I'm aware of for how to start actually cutting the use of fossil fuels at a level that's consistent with a problem we're facing.

[00:13:38] Um, thank you and agree. And two things, one I'm on a science-y mailing list, uh, that has a bunch of people who know like way too much about this stuff and like, It's not that this is a heated list of lots of disagreements it's that there are just so many options flying that it's kind of amazing. And then I don't remember if it's this list for different lists, but, uh, uh, [[Person/Amory Lovins]] is on one of those lists and is replying to questions about nuclear, the future of [[Topic/Nuclear Energy]], just with, with an incredible depth of detail and knowledge about how and what, and the knock-on effects and the actual costs and the, this and the, that.

[00:14:15] And it's just like, like crazy interesting, but all of which has me sort of realizing what a tangle, what to do is because, um, you 

[00:14:24] know,

[00:14:27] nuclear 

[00:14:30] the opposite. Okay. Yeah. He's, he's basically saying nuclear doesn't pan out at any scale in any way. 

[00:14:38] It's been pretty consistently for 40 some odd years. Yeah. Yeah. And people are trying to rise. He 

[00:14:45] can, he can show you the receipts. 

[00:14:47] Um, the problem with nuclear is you could put a major effort into it, but the oil companies keep pumping the oil.

[00:14:56] Yeah. Doug we're Doug and I disagree as I think there are lots of plants. I see lots of plans. I see tons of plants coming across my desk, latest one from Bloomberg this morning. Um, uh, there's not an agreement on a plan, but, um, you know, part of the deal here is that everybody, every sector in every company and every city is going to have to have their own.

[00:15:18] It's gotta be within a framework that has some commonality and sharing and com goals and so forth. But you're, you know, uh, I want to push back when you say we don't have a plan, who is we? Jerry? I think we found our topic. Who is we? And what is the venue for the plan being made the plant? Okay. So I'm not, I don't want to say plant.

[00:15:40] I want to say first steps and all the proposals. None of them say where we actually start cutting CO2 emissions at scale. Um, yeah. 

[00:15:54] And I, I just 

[00:15:55] ask about choosing the topic. Is this the chosen topic now? Because it's already going off on this topic 

[00:16:01] and I felt we were talking about WhatsApp. That's correct.

[00:16:04] Thank you. Thank you very much. And if you'd like to put a topic on the table, Uh, no, 

[00:16:11] I just want to check in and say, I haven't been in for a few weeks just cause I was on another project. And now that that's scheduled call has changed and I'll be here a little more regularly 

[00:16:20] and I'm glad to be back. We are happy to see you.

[00:16:23] Thank you. 

[00:16:24] It could be that the whole concept of plan and planning is becoming obsolete. And what is the sort of say replacing paradigm of that old way of thinking? 

[00:16:41] So two things on that one is that just last night I saw I've been [[StoryThreading]]. Um, I've been prototyping StoryThreading for [[Unfinished 21]], which is happening right now this week.

[00:16:53] Uh, virtual conference in Romania and last after yesterday, is 

[00:16:57] that yes, it was that a yes, this is the. 

[00:17:01] No, that was not right. That was not a, yes, we did it again. I'm 

[00:17:04] just pointing it out. We did it again. We started talking about this topic. Yeah. Which is fine, but I just want to make sure that we all chose 

[00:17:12] that topic.

[00:17:13] Yeah. And I'm, I'm unfortunately taking us into a digression. That's not necessary. It is about the topic, but it's actually about story threading. I just wanted to share this with the group and then come back in and ask for, uh, some consensus on the topic. Um, so if you'll, if you'll permit me a minute and a half here, uh, so.

[00:17:31] There was a session from the conference that I got to listen to ahead of time between who cares a lot about climate change. And one of the things that she says in this interview is basically that we don't have a [[new story]]. We don't have a consistent story, and I wanted to offer story versus plan. Uh, and she said basically that a unified direction for addressing climate change, hasn't been defined.

[00:17:54] And I connected that back up to, uh, a Ted talk that I mentioned here, uh, maybe last week, maybe four, which is one of my now favorites. Actually, I, I mentioned it on these calls that I've connected to the thought, and this is George. the new political story that could change everything. And he talks about how, what we need is a [[new story]] to replace the old story.

[00:18:17] Uh, and we don't have. And I'll just pause there. Uh, and then also, uh, my better half has written a book about flux that basically says we are in a world of constant flux. It's only going to get faster. What we need to do is manage in the middle of chaos. And Doug, do you have your hand up again or would you like to put your hand down for a bit?

[00:18:39] Okay. Um, thank you. So, so at this point, um, would someone like to offer either a favorite among the topics we've been talking about or a synthesis of some of the topics that we could talk about? Somebody recap the topics we've talked about? I we've been, I've been trying to note take them in the, in the chat.

[00:18:59] So, um, plans, planning, the worthlessness of planning, planning regarding, uh, climate change. Um, 

[00:19:09] I'm curious on the flux, you're gonna have to consult with your wife or, or, uh, can you give us some kind of. Resume, 

[00:19:18] or I know way too much about it. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so, um, let me, let me recap the topics and then I can do a brief thing on flex because then I can, uh, share my screen.

[00:19:33] Uh, so Gil, I think that goes right back up to this comment about hope and fear that we didn't get to plan so critical four-letter words. Uh, then you also mentioned NFTs and value and bullshit. Uh, Eric, uh, brought up who do, what do we think of as success individually and collectively? Uh, Gil mentioned Graybars LA posthumous book, the Dawn of everything.

[00:19:54] Uh, I brought up the metaverse and I think that's it for the topics we have on hand, 

[00:20:01] the one in the chat and combine some of them. 

[00:20:04] So planning, who is we flux first steps all in one. Um, can we state that as a short sentence? Like, um, who are we to planning. No, but those, 

[00:20:17] those first, those first, um, the, the, who is way defines how those other things are at, like the flux is the state, the, who is we as the perspective that we need to use when we're looking at the planning and how do we take the first steps?

[00:20:39] Anybody else? Uh, Julian, you have your hand up? Sorry.

[00:20:46] You are still needed. Yeah, there you go. Good. Okay. Yeah, I wasn't, it was hoping to take a couple of minutes to talk about this conference. I was at last week because it was a truly in the spirit of OGM and it was really wonderful. It's called dent. Uh, do you want to just take a, take a minute and. Okay. So the, uh, den comes from Steven jobs saying, dent the universe.

[00:21:10] If you're not putting the dent in the universe and what are you doing? And this, it was wonderful. I felt I've been an interdisciplinary person for decades, and this conference was absolutely interdisciplinary starting off from the first session, being a class on how to cook Chile's newest New Mexico style.

[00:21:28] Now going onto this place called Meow Wolf, which is a sort of themed attraction. 

[00:21:34] Um, they have a few of them around the U S 

[00:21:36] each one has a different focus. This one was about going through all these rooms full of , but all of them very 

[00:21:42] carefully placed 

[00:21:43] to give you clues as to solving the mystery. But then when we got seriously, the first session on Monday morning was the former head of disguise for the CIA talking about stories and the relationship to magic followed by a guy who has a company that makes a robot that goes into operating rooms and sterilizes the hell out of them.

[00:22:02] Um, using various kinds of spectrum of light. Uh, let's see,

[00:22:10] there was. There were a bunch of people talking about how they succeeded in life, the kind of mindset that they have in order to get things done, uh, going on to sessions about how does, uh, the, the division between right and left brains and how that affects every doing, um, and, uh, chunk kind of upsetting some of the classical right brain left brain prejudices.

[00:22:34] And then, uh, Valerie Plame, who was a CIA secret agent who was outed by the white house in 2003, I think was one of the speakers talking about how you reinvent your life when you are forcibly and unwillingly, thrust into the situation like, like Monica Lewinsky did. 

[00:22:52] Yeah. 

[00:22:55] Uh, let's see, uh, talking about one person talking about using horses as therapy for people, because course as it turns out, the genus is 56 million years old.

[00:23:06] So it's obviously got a lot of systems. Uh, my friend, Jerry Ellsworth is, uh, the kind of life sheets had in inventing and inventing 

[00:23:16] and trying things out and eventually founding tilt five, which can look upon the web. It's 

[00:23:21] an augmented reality gaming experience and then, uh, various sessions on, um, let's see, motivation.

[00:23:29] One of them, the one that I went to was by a guy, worked for Duncan yo-yos and spent 20 years traveling to elementary schools, inner city and motivating kids to, to, uh, through the use of. Showing them that spinning little blob of wood actually can do tricks and teaching them how to do it. Uh, one of the capitals of the week was what they called PowerPoint karaoke.

[00:23:51] And this was where you had to 

[00:23:52] come up with the most outlandish PowerPoint presentation you could think of, and then present the entire thing as if it was 

[00:23:59] a serious business proposition this the week, 

[00:24:03] whether it was just all over the place, there was a theme to it. I'd say that the theme this year was re-invention, but I loved it.

[00:24:11] And I wanted to bring it up because in OGM we talk a lot about 

[00:24:15] mixing ideas from different areas. And this conference to me was just about an epitome of that concept of mixing ideas. And this was the dent put on by Jason Preston and Steven rollback in sun valley. And was it virtual or face-to-face or now this was in Santa Fe and you know, it was in person and they were very hardheaded, like checking back.

[00:24:38] And those, and that's the right dent, cause there's a different hint as well from the same conference. This is the 20, 21 

[00:24:45] version of it. There's a dent on clubhouse, which is not 

[00:24:48] this right. Uh, and I've got a different dent. Um, Julian, thank you for that reporting. Um, I ask a 

[00:24:55] quick 

[00:24:55] question, Julian, if you had kind of one takeaway from the conference for you, what was it?

[00:25:01] Hmm. Uh, reinforce I've long felt that interdisciplinary research and development is the way that we really get problems solved. And this conference was an absolute reinforcement of that. 

[00:25:13] Now the question is what's, uh, Alan Weber 

[00:25:15] there? Uh, no. Well, wait, 

[00:25:19] it says, you know, mayor, um, set up, uh, the, uh, the city of Santa Fe.

[00:25:25] No, 

[00:25:26] there weren't any politicals there.

[00:25:31] So. 

[00:25:33] He was founder of, uh, the, uh, fast company magazine and earlier Harvard business review. So has traveled all the way from the academical most on culture to Santa Fe political culture,

[00:25:51] uh, prior, uh, speaker and attention. But you did bring up. One thing I forgot to mention was a long chat with Anne Marie. Uh, I'd have to look up her last water. I'd have to check. I don't remember, but she's an anthropologist, especially by one. Um, focusing on destruction of societies in Africa. And I was talking to her about my theories of describing history using graph databases.

[00:26:17] And that was a really thrilling chap finding even more, very cross-disciplinary connections. Very cool. Um, thank you for that, for that report in Julian, and also thank you for your injection of enthusiasm about that and its ODM Munis and so forth. Um, it's lovely. Um, and I strongly agree about interdisciplinarity and which is connected to diversity and a bunch of other issues.

[00:26:45] Um, yeah. So also a piece of what we're talking about is collective problem solving in some sense, and that may be an overgeneralization of why is there no plan or what are our next steps for climate change? Um, and gold go back back to Stacy's reframing, um, planning, who is we flux for steps? Um, how do we stay?

[00:27:11] How do we stay our conversation? And we don't, we don't need to be really precise. Uh, but. 

[00:27:20] I actually liked there was we, we, we went, you went through it really quick, but as we were talking about plans versus, um, stories, and then you said there was this great Ted talk to me, there was, there was a topic in there that actually hasn't been fully expressed.

[00:27:36] And then you leap to flux. And to me, that, that, and I forgot I'm losing track of what it was. But I remember for me, that was like, that's the topic? That's the topic I want to discuss, but I've forgotten 

[00:27:49] how you framed it. So piece of it that I think is close to what you're saying is that we don't have a new story.

[00:27:55] And that, and that the stories are kind of what, curious through different areas. And I'm happy to have, 

[00:28:00] yeah, to me, it's more about like, whether we're talking about a plan or story or whatever, what, what is this new story that we're aiming, that, that we need to start telling ourselves in order to create the solutions in new ways.

[00:28:13] Right. That, to me, something about that for me is, is at the core. That's 

[00:28:18] what I want to talk about. Would you write that on the chat please? Or, or if anybody else took that sentence down? Um, that sounds really good to me. Um, anybody else and hear the word story in that sentence, I think is carrying, uh, carrying the freight of plans and planning and of steps and, uh, things like that.

[00:28:40] Um, I might turn a little metal input on that. We have an implicit thinking of planning as, as a linear process. It's definitely not. Um, uh, it's very much a longer process, which means it's a third dimension and we don't train that in traditional, uh, managerial, uh, education, um, hardly in any other education as well, but a little bit in math, a little bit in physics, um, and in, uh, astronomy, uh, we can perhaps see that the, the spaceship is navigating with this kind of third dimension.

[00:29:27] So I would like to have the longest you as a keyword to the OGM, 

[00:29:34] um, and lung lung tattooed, um, by, I'm not sure that's a clear word for all of us. Uh, I think that's the problem. Because you're using it metaphorically. Can you say a little bit more about it? 

[00:29:51] No, no. It's, uh, it's much deeper than that. You have all the latitude, but the longest you have this in between, and that implies that it's the third dimension, which needs a lot of training in your perception to see the third dimension and, um, also to put numbers to it.

[00:30:12] And that's why it's a very, very important to learn, to develop the metrics for the long YouTube.

[00:30:24] It's all related 

[00:30:25] to the relation of the earth. 

[00:30:28] Okay. Uh, let's, let's hold that thought in the conversation. Um, I, I want to do a brief thing, which is, um, share screen and just go back to flux because it's related now to our conversation. Um, So one of the assumptions behind April's book is that we are in a, the world is in flux.

[00:30:51] We are in a state of flux. Uh, and one of the assertions she makes, which I'm not fully on board with is that, um, we are, the world is like never, if we think right now as fast, it's just going to keep getting faster. And I'm a believer in sort of punctuated equilibrium, which is, uh, that periodically we go through these states of change and then we wind up in another kind of status or a kind of set of things, norms and whatever else that that lasts for a long time.

[00:31:19] But, um, but in her book, she came up with these eight flux superpowers and I'll go through them quickly because you'll see that they're pretty related. So a run slower, slow your pace stop. The usual thing about must, must keep up much, must run faster, uh, see what's invisible, which means look at the periphery, which means integrate other things, which is a little bit the interdisciplinarity, although I'm not sure she goes there.

[00:31:43] Uh, get law. Which is like, don't, you know, don't stay on the path, go find other places, go trip into other, other kinds of things. Start with trust, which builds a lot on my work and mentions my work and the chapter, but, but sort of, uh, uh, assume good intent and build from there. Um, restart to realize when you, when you have enough, not that you are enough, but when you have enough, what is enoughness, um, which relates a lot to the stories and narratives that we have going about consumerism.

[00:32:13] That mean we can never have enough, which is part of the reason why we're eating the earth and, you know, polluting the earth, um, create a portfolio career, which is less related to here, uh, be all the more human, which means let's, let's like, let's like actually be human with each other. Uh, and then let go of the future, which has a lot to do with plans and planning.

[00:32:33] And she goes into that some here. Uh, but the idea of, uh, you know, if you thought you had a plan, guess what? It's a little bit like Mike Tyson's quote, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Um, and. And I also want to bring up here just briefly because it's really relevant. Uh, in, in Dave Snowden's Cynefin framework, uh, the way you deal with a complicated setting is really different from how you deal with a complex setting in a complicated setting, experts can help you, and you basically want to, uh, diagnose that, let the experts diagnose the problem, pick among the different solutions, and then implement that in a complex setting.

[00:33:12] Experts will screw you up as more often than they'll help you probably. And you actually want to, I think probe sense and respond, uh, was, was, uh, the, the alignment of things, which w by which he says, create a lot of experiments, see what works and then keep working toward what's working. And that's really interesting because I think we may be needing to adapt a planning mode that is a distributed diverse.

[00:33:36] Closely inter twinkled meaning inter reported and collaborative set of, of ways of working our way forward in this mess also because the climate problem is a big thorny hairball of lots of different issues. Uh, Phil,

[00:33:57] uh, we are not hearing you, 

[00:34:00] I'm sorry, too many, too many, 

[00:34:02] not enough 

[00:34:03] fingers. Um, uh, Mike Tyson. Yeah. Um, echoes of George Patton, you know, resonates with Dwight Eisenhower, pat, uh, Tyson. In fact, he had a plan to condition himself to be strong and agile and resilient. Be able to take punch, have reflexes, uh, emotional fortitude to not freak out when he's got he's.

[00:34:26] He basically cultivated the capacity to be in the ring and be effective. That was the plan, not the plan for what do I do when I get hit on the left side of my head. That's too specific. So there's different layers of planning. And I put in the chat, um, noted to Doug that, uh, you know, California is 40 years into a

[00:34:45] plan, one might say trajectory, uh, that's focused on the principles of efficiency, renewables, and electrification as the priority stack and decades of policies, funding, measures, and so forth and support that general plan and direction. So my question is why is that not a plant? Um, And then if we get into that, you said the general question is there's there's there's layers, uh, or, uh, what's I, maybe that's not the right word there.

[00:35:17] They're sort of dimensions of plans from highly general framing to very specific tactical. And we may be get messed up in 

[00:35:24] there, but, and entities, the scale of governments need to do things like that. I need to figure out where they're going to apply resources, budget, uh, how they're going to reconfigure themselves in Germany.

[00:35:34] There's the [[Topic/Energiewende], which is like, how do we move toward green? There's lots of governments that have been out leading with different flavors of plans. I think partly our conversation is that why isn't there a more unified plan? Are we, are we wishing that there were more 

[00:35:49] the question? That's a very different question and it's an important one.

[00:35:53] Um, uh, gerans work comes to mind here and we can get into that mode if we get into this topic, but how do you have independent action in a coordinated 

[00:36:03] direction? Yeah, thanks Gill. 

[00:36:07] Well, I think as I touched upon it earlier, the, the issue is the plan. Um, um, therefore, uh, we have to get out of that paradigm and start to see another way of, uh, addressing the situation.

[00:36:23] And also another Texoma me to describe it, then furthermore, another metrics to measure it because we are measuring the wrong stuff and we are talking about the wrong stuff. And then we try to get, uh, the plan as a kind of navigational tool when it's full storm out there.

[00:36:44] Um, anybody else and Gil, if you want to put your hand down, unless you're stepping back from the. 

[00:36:51] Well, I want to say again, that what I am interested in is the fact that we have plans or goals, things like that. We have no first steps. So to cut a fossil fuel use by 50% by 2035 does not tell us who has to do something this week or the rest of this year to meet that goal.

[00:37:14] And partly the problem is that people do not want to say the obvious, and that is that cutting fossil fuels is going to ricochet throughout the economy. It's going to unemploy people, stop businesses and have cascading effects that are very dangerous and nobody wants to go there, but we have to go there.

[00:37:34] I think we're, we're kind of at this strange moment where. Really big things need to happen. And all the big things are going to have repercussions and they're going to have some modestly predictable repercussions, and they're going to have a whole bunch of unintended consequences and other kinds of things that are going to bounce through the system.

[00:37:50] And we don't have a particularly good way of seeing which of those are actually happening, which of those are not, uh, talking through the implications and connecting with the effected parties, uh, changing plans that are backfiring. Like, like I see lots of people saying, no, we have to do this. No, we have to do this, but we were not working on figuring out how to coordinate those attempts so that we can work better on the ones that are, that are actually working when we discover them, uh, and, and backwards.

[00:38:19] And then to layer a complexity onto that, um, you know, exponential change. The first couple of dots don't look like. It will change. So you actually, in the early going, it'll be really hard to tell which of these things are actually working or which is the runaway, the runaway iron filing problem that dissolves all the oxygen in the oceans or something like that, that we could be well along on the wrong process before we noticed to reign it in a grace over to you.

[00:38:45] Yeah. So I wanted to relate to this story thing and, uh, as we're talking about plans and stories and, and, and I guess I, you know, growing recipes [[Person/David Graeber]] a little bit, like what is the story that's in place that is so pervasive that people can't talk outside of it. And that story is the story of money and finances, right?

[00:39:08] Like saying about that, like, when you say resources and money, it's like this resources thing, right. Um, the project that I've been working on the last few few weeks, or I wasn't here is this thing with this blockchain thing where they're talking about impact claims and how do we translate things like carbon credits into a monetary value.

[00:39:31] And we're so stuck in this story of value being measured by something called money and that somehow we could like equivalent everything out. And it's very bizarre. And I've been really stuck in this story, if you will like the story, like, for example, when people talk about communism in capitalism, they talk about the means of production, right?

[00:39:53] It means the production in the hands of, well, who's, in the hands of who, right. And I'm like, you know, When I think about the means of productions, I'm like, I've got a uterus and nobody can take that means of production for me. Like I can produce people well, not anymore, but at one point I produced some people, but it's like this it's this craziness, right?

[00:40:12] This craziness, like if you had to measure the value of the people I produced, like, is that negative or positive? I mean, they've got a carbon footprint, but you know, whatever they served their country or they did this, or they did that. Like, it's insane. It's just insane. And again, this feminist economics, it's insane.

[00:40:29] Cause it's all like, we're gonna, we're going to use this one thing called money. And it doesn't even matter if we call it money or whatever, and that's going to measure everything and it's just dramatically crazy. It's a crazy. There's no. And one of the examples I give is mentoring. Like people come to me and they want mentoring, right.

[00:40:47] Or they want to do a free consultation. I give a lot of free consultations because I love talking to people and they're like, well, what do you get in return? And I'm like, well, at this point in my life, I get the satisfaction of knowing somebody won't make the same mistake I already made. And that's it, that's the exchange.

[00:41:03] I got a fair trade. They listened to my advice. That was it. And you know, I might've saved them. There's cases where I know I've saved people millions and it's like, yeah, but it was fair. And so it's just, you know, our [[new story]] has to include a very different paradigm for what's meaningful. Right. What's meaningful.

[00:41:28] And it's like Star Trek World is kind of the closest we get to that, but there's something like about what's meaningful. And what does it mean to be a human being and. And what are the things we want to look at and, and how do we measure, like the things that I think we need to measure more like flows?

[00:41:43] Like, what are the upward spirals in what direction are things going? It's not, did we reach this carbon emission? It's like, is this particular location in an upward, downward spiral? Is this person, is this society? Yeah, [[Person/Paul Krafel]], right? It's like this, we need to be measuring the motion of things towards vitality, which is a very different measure.

[00:42:06] And we don't really know how to do it. 

[00:42:08] So a couple of things just to get a little more position for me. Um, where were you, were you saying that feminist economics is overly obsessed with money and measure money as a matter. I am I connecting those two 

[00:42:21] in some ways? Yes. And you know, just the word triggers you, it's like what's feminist economical.

[00:42:26] Like what does that mean? Right. Like, yeah. It's too triggered on. Yeah. And there's things you, the reason I heard [[Person/Heather Hines]] say this, and the reason that the things that are measured are so masculine in monetary terms is that [[Topic/If You Measure The Feminine Things, You Corrupt Them]]. Right. Look, my mommy has more mommy points.

[00:42:49] Look, I got some free sex. It's like, you know, like you corrupt them immediately by measuring them. That hug was worth. So it's not like 

[00:42:59] some. Yeah, it just, 

[00:43:02] you can't measure like, oh, my mom loves me more than your mom. 

[00:43:06] So this is like the beginning of [[Person/David Graeber]]'s' other book, [[Book/Debt]], where he says that the myth, the myth that money replaces barter ([[Topic/Primacy of Money]]) is bullshit.

[00:43:15] The original money is for increments or bowls like a slave or a bride. And then we kind of go from there and suddenly one of the reasons I love [[Book/The Great Transformation]] by [[Person/Karl Polanyi]] is that he's saying, Hey, Hey people, before the industrial economy, everything didn't have a price. And there were all these other ways in which we stayed alive, which we've completely forgotten.

[00:43:33] And can't even imagine now to the point where we've baked into the [[Topic/Sustainable Development Goals]], that everybody's got to have X number of dollars a day, or they're going to die. Right. And you're, you're envisioning. And I would love to figure out what is the conversation where we can have a very different world, uh, that works in different ways, but, but the world has been eaten by money and all these models you're talking about.

[00:43:55] Um, so thank you for bringing that in fam. Welcome to the call. Let's go, Sam, lay Frick. Hey, 

[00:44:00] well, I mean, the only reason I raised my hand and listening to what grace talked about there, and I realized I had one point, which is that, you know, I, I do a lot of work in communities where most of the time that people are framing all of this around economic transactions and the framing, everything, all problem solving, all policy, all aspects of society are mostly measured by dollars and cents in the, in the real world projects that I work on right now.

[00:44:30] Um, and I re a long time ago, I, I got to work with [[Person/Chris Cohen]], who was a student of [[Person/Clare W. Graves]]. And they came up with this whole [[Topic/Spiral Dynamics]] thing. But Clare W. Graves was like a psychologist. 

[00:44:41] And he realized that, you know, 

[00:44:43] people were operating from worldviews and it had it, their worldview was partially what's going on in their mind.

[00:44:49] And then what's in the environment. Like I see like a combination of the. And the, and the, the gene organism and environment like [[Person/Richard Lewontin]] talked about in [[Book/The Triple Helix]] book, and 

[00:45:00] that cleared up your graves through observing people, saw that you can't really get people to change that. First of all, the problems that you all are talking about here are probably largely human problems.

[00:45:11] And that once you can create the conditions for change, then people will adapt to the technology or see the different economy or whatever it is. But first it's like, it's like a human inertia. That's currently, they have those, the wagons are circled in a worldview right now for what Jerry just described as saying like, we're very heavy into this.

[00:45:33] Everything's been eaten up by the dollar economy and there's, there's, there's a million different other ways to solve these problems. But until people are until the environment, the conditions are in the environment that create the conditions for the human beings to be ready to change their worldview.

[00:45:49] And even then, there's not a guarantee. According to [[Person/Clare W. Graves]], even if you create the conditions, it doesn't guarantee that people, you can't force people to change their worldview. 

[00:45:59] So that one insight that I wanted to share with just that, that we have to create the 

[00:46:04] conditions for change. To get people out of the mindset of, of thinking that a transactional currency based economy needs to be in place for everything that we 

[00:46:15] do.

[00:46:16] Um, and 

[00:46:17] beyond that, there's already a bunch of sound theory from people like [[Person/Elinor Ostrom]] and everybody else about how we could go about doing this. And there's decades of work from people that have proven that we can do things in a different way. And now it just literally boils down to people just sitting and looking at other people.

[00:46:33] Like they're crazy because they're not ready to operate that way. They're not ready to change their worldview. I think it's a big 

[00:46:40] part of it. Anyway. That's what I had to say. Listening to this. Love that, Sam. Thank you. Um, uh, so many interesting forces at play here. Let's go lay Frick, Wendy. 

[00:46:55] So, um, uh, I think, uh, w what Wendy was referring to, it's extremely interesting and very good.

[00:47:01] Then also the reference to restaurant, we need to have, uh, another way of scoring and developing the metrics, not measuring the metrics for value creation. That's why, uh, the [[Topic/SECI model of knowledge dimensions]] of [[Person/Ikujiro Nonaka]] in Japan is extremely interesting. It's a spiritual development between you and society and the enterprise in a spiritual dynamics.

[00:47:30] Very interesting. And also as a route for the development of the intangible economy in Japan. But the other dimension of this is that we have to lift up. And this is a little bit of the trick. I mentioned the traditional metrics. One plus one equals two, but actually the new one is one plus one equals 11.

[00:47:56] Um, um, so I'd say elevation is the leadership challenge, which is in long attitude metrics. So we should come back to that later on, but in the accounting system, it's not the metrics per seat. That is a problem. It's the accounting community looking at, uh, assets and depths. And we are even starting now to talk about, um, societal depths and, uh, welfare and illness steps and the hospital.

[00:48:33] And then we start to focus on the wrong dimension, but that will not lift us up. 

[00:48:39] Um, thank you, Sam, if you want to lower your hand, unless you want to go back in the queue. Um, and, uh, I just remembered a comment. I wanted to say at the end of what you had said, which was, and we have a huge number of humans on earth who think that cryptocurrencies and accounting for things on the blockchain or in distributed ledgers are going to solve all of our, all of our problems, uh, which goes right back up as far as I can tell that's alternate money, uh, and smart contracts are ways of, of ratifying human language and locking it down and sort of pinning it so that we can say, oh, this is what we agreed on.

[00:49:13] And I'm troubled by this whole thing at the same moment as I'm attracted to it like a moth to a flame. Um, and I know that some of us have been been experimenting in that, in that sphere. And learning, you know, learning lessons about what's happening there. But, but I think that in a world where we need to detach ourselves from measuring everything and valuing it with money and, and extrinsic rewards, corrupt, intrinsic motivation, I think is a different way of saying, uh, what grace put in the conversation a little earlier.

[00:49:40] And when you then extrinsically sort of measure and reward everything, you really screw things up. The reason I didn't participate much in the media network early on is that you could give people points when they don't, you know, contributed something good. But the number of points you hit accrued in the network hung around after your, your, your name, um, in a parenthesis.

[00:49:59] So it was like, here's my name? And here's my score for how many people have given me goodies in the network, which was just bizarre. Um, grace, thank you for sharing your cat with us and Kevin, you had a puppet in front of you earlier. I'm still curious about what that puppet was. Uh, but let's go to a rink quickly.

[00:50:16] That was Rumi, who was skeptical of Western. Oh, I love that. I didn't realize there was a roomy dollar. I might have to go there. Um, thank you. Uh, Rick, Wendy, and then Sam again. 

[00:50:29] Yeah, thanks very much. First time comer, actually, Kevin, I thought that that was punching Judy. You were going to do there, but that's what you're trying to do.

[00:50:37] Not really, but anyway, um, this week I listened to a hidden brain and it was about the plant if you heard it. But, but the metaphors they use there, which I thought were quite clever, but they were limited, um, was looking at the cop 26, uh, conference as a, uh, is it, is it our dunk cook? And my immediate reaction was this is the wrong 

[00:51:03] metaphor.

[00:51:04] And I, and I want to touch on a point, I think, uh, great, 

[00:51:08] um, um, female 

[00:51:12] women, female power and how it's different to 

[00:51:14] men. And if we change our metaphors, I think it's a critically important to change away from metaphors to equal metaphors. 

[00:51:23] Um, what's dissipated in 

[00:51:26] a Canadian group that, uh, of academics, um, 

[00:51:31] the whole 

[00:51:31] discipline of ecological economics and creating a flourishing, uh, and the language is very different.

[00:51:40] So I knew some of the players in that. So it was fascinating to grow that. But what I want to come to is how we're trapped by our current narrative structures and the hero's journey, which is totally. Broken. And so we need to actually, co-create a living story movement of lifelong learning about hope, how we can, co-design an equitable regenerative and sustainable future.

[00:52:04] And we need a new language for that. And we have to get away from talking about values and talking about virtues, and we need our virtues to guide our values. So we don't get so transfixed on metrics, money, et cetera, et cetera, which doesn't help us move the needle, um, that we're going to be facing, uh, with the onslaught of a whole series of black Swan events.

[00:52:30] And I'll, I'll put a blog post in that speaks to this whole way. That's my musings. In the morning, I call myself an equity muse and I, I I'm, I'm trying to mentor mentors who would like to be equity, muses, and asking and encouraging people to ask much more evocative questions that make us much more dynamic.

[00:52:48] Anyway, that's. 

[00:52:51] Um, Rick, here you are. And when I brain as equity muse, uh, and, uh, some of the, a few of the things we've been working on, and if you add the post, I will add it here in my brain

[00:53:05] and let's go to, uh, Wendy.

[00:53:11] Yeah. So echoing that, I think I'm loving this thread about how can we weave the new story? Um, it was connecting to what Sam was saying about changing people's perspectives and beliefs. Um, I love what grace added, um, from the beginning, uh, that kind of kicked this off. And I just want to say, I think there's, there's quite a few different frames.

[00:53:35] Frameworks for how we could break up society in a healthier way, whether it's like the wheel of co-creation. I know there's another co a couple of other ones. It might, I'm just want to offer up that. My, my thoughts started to go there, going, we could start with, you know, trying to, trying to frame a new story, at least in each of these disciplinary areas of society.

[00:54:00] I think it's a lot to ask that we come up with some kind of overarching something, but I would love the exercise of trying to at least in some sections. Even if we take what we think the story is now, right. We probably could identify that pretty well. And then like kind of try and flip it 180 or something like that.

[00:54:18] Almost like a mental exercise of trying to rewrite the story. What would it look like? And what does it sound like? And we don't necessarily need to get to the new story, but it would be a nice exercise to at least start to put a positive spin or a new re-imagining on top of it. I bet this group would be a great group to start to weave that.

[00:54:39] Um, and I will say that there are many, many, many individuals and organizations trying to come up with new stories and the talk that I've pointed to by George Monbiot, uh, he presents his story. And he contrasts it in story frame to the previous stories that it needs to replace. Um, and it's interesting, and it hasn't sold well enough that everybody's like on the same page with the same story, but I don't know that Wendy, that we have to invent one from whole cloth.

[00:55:05] Uh, and I, and I, and I don't want to stop us from trying, cause that's, you know, easy enough to, to generate words and think about them and put them in the world. But there's a bunch of people working on this story or set of stories to figure out how it works. And, uh, from my perspective, um, we are currently living inside of so many different rings of sort of concentric and overlapping and mutually reinforcing cycles of dysfunction.

[00:55:32] About whether we're enough about whether we have enough money, about how to compete in society about zero sum. That's about the, the, the, you know, the current logics and means of, of, uh, neoliberal, globalist capitalism and consumerism and all that kind of stuff. They won't all come undone at one time. And I'm extremely interested in finding, um, the subtle small thing that will cause people to start to tip and behave differently in the face of the current system.

[00:56:04] And here, one of my heroes is Milton Erickson, who was a hypnotist and therapist back in the day. And he had this way, he, he, his Mo was to try to open a conversation with your unconscious, which he did through hypnosis and give your unconscious more options, more behavioral repertory at the moment when you were approaching the thing that you had a problem with.

[00:56:23] So if you had a phobia about crossing bridges, he would talk to your subconscious and say, Hey, what if you pulled over and took a couple of breaths? What if you, whatever. And I'm, I'm, I'm kind of making things up here, but, but he was skilled at very small interventions that cause large scale behavioral change in his clients because he understood that psychology.

[00:56:42] And I'm trying to find what is the subtle knife that lets us do this at a social scale. What is the tiny story that will carry like free hugs carries? Right. Free hugs carried really, really well. The ice bucket challenge, strangely enough, there's probably a million charities in the world going, why didn't we think of the ice bucket challenge?

[00:57:00] Dammit. We could have made a fortune, but, but that's a mean that curated really well, although it wasn't transformative because it was nonsense. It was pouring ice over your head. It wasn't about behavioral change. It was just a way to collect money. But, but, but these things really traveled, traveled excellently.

[00:57:15] And with all these little, all these little social media things that we critique and deprecate all the time, get more travel, then major news media than everybody else, like, like the, the normal standard media entities and a book don't get that much readership or audience compared to all these other things that are traveling around the world.

[00:57:35] Um, 

[00:57:36] yeah. I mean, there's a, there's so much in what you were just saying that that's, that's interwoven together in my mind. One is, you know, what, what motivates humans to change is a whole science in and of itself, right? Where, uh, Right. Like that's a whole, that's a whole conference or a week long that could just be on that alone in terms of, um, and, and there's a lot of great science behind it.

[00:58:01] Um, and what we think is going to be motivating then sometimes also isn't when it comes to social media. So there's a whole nother layer on terms of like what makes things viral is not actually what makes people change their behavior. Right. So to your point again, about the ice bucket challenge, right?

[00:58:17] That, that might've gone viral, but it's not necessarily something that changed. It changed everybody's behavior amongst. Right. So to me, that's where, um, to me that's more complicated even then we need to get an and to me, the story isn't necessarily about the solutions we're trying to provide. The story goes back more to the hero's journey version.

[00:58:36] That the reason why the hero's journey is something that speaks to us is because there's something deeper in our psyche that is about this journey that we all make, that we believe we need to go through hell and suffering in order to come out this other side with some, some token of greatness and bring that back into our communities to rise up our communities.

[00:58:59] To me, that cycle is changing. And I see that cycle changing, um, in, especially in kind of the next generation of going, do we really need, I mean, there's all bunch of questions popping up. Do we really need to suffer before we can make a change? Do we really need it? Right. Like all these questions about, and, and is it only one person that gets to be the hero or could more people be a hero together?

[00:59:22] And what does hero look like anyway? And do we really have to have conflict in our stories for them to be interesting? All these things that we have imbued and all believer important structures from which we, we tell our narratives both individually and collectively are starting to break apart with the systems too, that are breaking apart.

[00:59:43] I, I just feel like that to me, it's about that. It's not necessarily about coming to a solution. It's about starting to just tell ourselves a different narrative that has a powerful ripple effect. If we find the narrative that speaks to something in our site, That calls us forward, um, and, and stops putting us in a position of being the reluctant hero that needs to make the journey.

[01:00:07] And instead the inspired hero that works collaboratively with it. I mean, I don't know, that's the 

[01:00:13] point, um, that was super juicy and connected for me. Thank you one day. Um, and the, like, why is there one hero is sort of this kind of Western mythological. We, you know, we have a hero and we de if I, the hero and we do that with business heroes, right.

[01:00:31] And, and, uh, we, we put, you know, Jack Welch used to be like a hero across the U S until he was a pariah, uh, for some people and still a hero for a bunch of people. But, but we have that neck, I used to look at fortune magazine and partly at Forbes magazine, like America's two big business magazines back in the day as, as Hey geographies.

[01:00:50] Like, Hey, we're going to talk about how fabulous these, you know, deans of industry are. Um, and then on conflict, a brief note. I actually kind of liked conflict in the process for different reasons, but here I'm building on stock pecs community building model, where, which convinced me years ago that that, um, community and trust are forged through difficulty and that facing difficulty in sticking together through difficulty and make and solving things through difficulty, actually bond us into in ways that we don't bond when we're just working at the surface going, Hey, I like you.

[01:01:23] You're kind of, you're kind of cool. Let's talk. Right. And so there's a different conversation to be had there that I'd love to go back into. Um, let's go Sam Gill, Rick, Doug. 

[01:01:34] All right. Yeah. I'll, I'll try to keep what I'm saying brief here, but I realized that that earlier, I mean, I liked everything. That Wendy's said, but I'm, I'm not even gonna try to respond because I'll just take up a lot of time.

[01:01:46] And when she said it better than I ever could. So, 

[01:01:49] um, anyway, I was 

[01:01:50] listening to the talk about how we're, you know, it's, on the one hand, it can be destructive to create some kind of measurement system that assigns, like, let's say 

[01:02:00] monetary value to everything. 

[01:02:02] But on the other hand, we do use a measurement for, let's say, we want to know what it's going to be like outside before we go out.

[01:02:07] And we're going to look at the weather, a mess of 

[01:02:09] measurement, you know, and the work that I do. Um, 

[01:02:12] I was asked to come in and help people try to like re regionalize food systems and try to gain the benefits from bringing food systems back to original level, where they have been quite, uh, consolidated and, and, and, and, um, centralized in the United States for various reasons.

[01:02:30] And so, One of the first things that I did was I created this giant dashboard of like all of the food economy stuff going on in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, which is where Pittsburgh 

[01:02:40] is at. And then, 

[01:02:41] you know, that, you know, that didn't really have a massive impact with people just to see that. And even though they can see like, oh, millions of dollars happenings of business happening here, that's important.

[01:02:53] But for us to, for us to actually be able to get traction and really move things forward, we also had to do, I got university of Pittsburgh students involved and we had to do a combination of qualitative. Listening to people. And basically what we've discovered that the more that we sat down and listened to people and gave them an outlet to talk about how the supply to their problems, the more that the measurement was valid and the more they can see how to utilize that.

[01:03:21] And the more that we could reflect all of that back to people and make it their asset. So if you were, whether your people in a neighborhood that has food security and you have no grocery store in your neighborhood, or whether you're a, a grocery store chain that wants to bring local food into your grocery store or whatever, all these different things that people were trying to do with local and regional food, nothing really moved until we.

[01:03:44] Everyone talking to each 

[01:03:46] other. 

[01:03:46] And it almost all of the problems needed to be solved with partnerships and everyone had a story and 

[01:03:52] all of the people had, 

[01:03:53] you guys were all talking about here was all like the building blocks towards making just this one problem work. But we had to basically like sit down and keep ingesting and reflecting back and processing what people were saying.

[01:04:06] And I think not only did that help in giving a different way to kind of like have a pulse on what's happening from the human side of it. But also I realized people started to feel listened to, and in many other areas they weren't being listened to. And they'd rather come to people that are listening to what they're saying and work with them than just like struggle around in the dark and try to like figure out how to do things.

[01:04:29] That's, uh, that's now a big component of what I do, even though I was hired to do data science. I also try to take some of Elinor Ostrom's kind of qualitative research approach to things and step out and listen to people. And we always try to make it a point to reflect back whatever insights we find, the men and everyone else in their community and the analytics of the data.

[01:04:50] About the community as well. Like how many people live there and whatever it may be altogether. So we're trying to create that feedback loop and make it an asset. Um, but I think that's important and that helps people hear and understand each other's stories of somebody constantly taking on the responsibility to do that.

[01:05:06] Then I local and regional levels. You can start to, if you decided that you wanted to move the needle on something, you would have to get in there and listen to people and hear what they have to say. They're going to tell you how they can do it in their 

[01:05:16] context. Humans are smart and they're eager to have the conversations you're describing.

[01:05:21] I love what you just said. And it reminds me of Andy lip kiss and treat people done in LA, who was just a left plant, more trees activist, who wound up being the catalyst for a series of conversations across agencies in the LA basin, federal state, government, whatever, whatever a city who didn't know, they had conflicting mandates, overlapping resources, idle, idle resources, uh, et cetera, et cetera.

[01:05:44] And once they started talking, we're able to act much more in concert. And sometimes it's, sometimes it's just convening a safe place to let people go solve the problems. And it's usually as Eleanor would tell us, um, the people closest to a problem that know best what to do about it. That's really often the case, which is why one of the principles of her governing commons is let the people who are closest to the commons, sort of do the managing, um, Gilbert.

[01:06:11] Oh, 

[01:06:12] okay. I'll do it right now. Well, I was, uh, communicate with Gil on email, uh, recently, and he's got some folks who want to do, um, you know, climate adaptation 

[01:06:26] cities at scale. 

[01:06:28] And I was suggesting the folks I work with, uh, are mostly in heat sinks. Uh, you know, if it's hotter in their neighborhoods, they aren't trees there isn't good drainage.

[01:06:39] And, uh, one way to solve that is related to a story that we're working on that's work. Uh, and in this neighborhood in Indianapolis, we use this thing called a neighborhood vitality index to, uh, make the social capital and resilience and. Sure we'll support more clear in this neighborhood. And one bank there has reduced the cost of mortgage financing because their perception of risk of this poor, mostly black neighborhood has gone down because the social capital is physical.

[01:07:12] And so if you refinance the mortgage, you know, the asset is therefore going to be more valuable. Therefore the tax basis increased, therefore it's more easy to solve 8 cents. And so it's a, it's one of these odd things that, you know, where environmentalist can actually be on the side of justice for all people by, uh, but it was really this, this tool is good enough that a bank says, oh, this neighborhood is less risky.

[01:07:37] So 

[01:07:39] we're looking to replicate that, that tool in 

[01:07:42] a lot of the work we do. Thanks, Kevin.

[01:07:48] That'd be cool. I have a participant named Gil wreck actually, but go ahead and go. Well, we 

[01:07:52] can, we can mock one up, Kevin. Thank you. Um, golly, Sam, thank you, Wendy. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Um, one of the threads I'm hearing here is the, is the one in the many and kind of the ongoing tension dynamic tension that we have in the way that we think can be in the world about the great, the great man theory of history, the hero that we're talking about and the heroism of everybody, the story, and the many stories, the way that the story changes is not be somebody writing the right story.

[01:08:18] It's by a lot of people telling different stories. And at some point they, they coalesce and become adopted. Uh, this is, you know, so I think that's some of what Erickson is doing, and it's very much what Graybar is doing in this new book where he's basically a certain, I'm only a hundred pages into, I think an 800 or 900 page book.

[01:08:34] What he's basically saying is that the, the given story of human history, actually the two given stories, Hobbs, and. You know, we, uh, we were brutes and now we're sophisticated or we were angels and now we're shit. Those were kind of those two stories we live in. He says, no, if you look, if you look at the anthropology over the last 30 or 40,000 years, human history is much more diverse, much more experimental, uh, and much more, um, would say a choice.

[01:09:02] People have, have chosen to step back from empire and consolidation and great man and so forth. And he is basically, as I'm reading it so far saying there's a lot of options in the world. There are lots of ways we have done things and therefore can do things. Uh, there's a, um, I posted this somewhere, the, uh, the piece in, uh, in Germany, Um, that is the one that assert that the kind of push puts this book in the league with Galileo and Darwin says, David Graber knew that ordinary people could remake the world because they do.

[01:09:36] And the work that we do in the storytelling, it's not to find that story, but to propagate many, it's not defined the plan, but to propagate many and find as much as possible common framework in all those. And so that, to me, that's very interesting. Austram provides a coherent framework and a highly diverse, um, emergent processes of adaptation and, you know, to finish, we, everybody runs around looking for the silver bullet hunter.

[01:10:03] Eleven's talks about silver buckshot, you know, many, many, many small projectiles names and a general direction, rather than trying to find the one thing that solves everything. Everything is far too complex to lend itself to single solution. I'm loving this conversation. Thank you everybody. 

[01:10:22] Same here.

[01:10:22] Thank you. 

[01:10:25] Kudos to what Kevin said. I owe you a response on that. One of the angles there that he's, that he's nibbling at, I think there's more to go there is that if in fact there is something called ecosystem services that have value. If we can enhance the ecosystem functionality of a heat sink neighborhood or a city we're generating value that there's, that is not yet captured monetized or incorporated into the scheme of things.

[01:10:49] And I'm not saying we should monetize it, but we should certainly value it so that we can nourish or the story of risks that banks, by letting them see the soap that they make visible, the social capital that's there, that they're not trained. Yep. Well, we're lifting up, we're lifting up both the social capital and the ecological capital, neither of which are they trying to look for?

[01:11:13] There's a, 

[01:11:15] Kevin is putting those together in these communities that are generally overlooked by all sorts of. 

[01:11:21] Yeah, it an interesting conversation sort of behind the conversation we're having here about what to measure and what to value and how to value it. Grace kind of started that conversation, but, but, um, I think I need to sit and stew on that some more because, because for me, um, very, very often all too often, we monetize and then measure things that we shouldn't even be touching.

[01:11:44] Um, and here we're saying, Hey, in order to make the system work for neighborhoods that don't get mortgages, for example, we needed to make visible some of the value that was flowing there for people in a way that was intelligible to them. And once they saw it, they were like, oh, okay, let's land. And that's, that's really interesting because we're working at different layers in the system here.

[01:12:03] And, and, um, I think the design of values to value measurement value metrics and so forth is going to be a crucial, crucial thing moving forward. Um, thank you for all of that. Uh, Mr. Thank 

[01:12:18] you. I just want to build on what Wendy was talking about. Um, and it, it reminded me of a book called, uh, if you see what are on the road, kill him.

[01:12:29] Um, and in some respects we have to kill the hero's journey and the hero, because the hero can't save us and it's a, it's a complete mythology. And so how can we shift beyond this to stories of heroicism with the royal we, and, um, a couple of books that came to mind, um, as I was thinking about what I was going to say was how can we create living story and movements based upon the open innovation work of Henry Jasper, and also.

[01:13:01] John door's book on measure, what matters, um, because that provides a framework for innovation. How can we scale up the, uh, innovation, capacities and capabilities of ordinary people? Because that's the only way that we're going to scale up something that's going to have any measure of mitigating against the disasters we're going to be facing in the future with climate change.

[01:13:26] So. I'm just wondering whether, what, what resources people have come across about what, what is the new narrative that we're going to have to create that, um, allows us to be able to, uh, exponentiate our responses because, um, we're so divided. There's so much polarization around and unless we can unravel our, our political quagmires that are handicapping our abilities to respond, we're w we're not going to, we're not going to be very effective.

[01:13:57] We need the three sectors working together, the political, the public, and the private. Unfortunately, they're at 

[01:14:04] war with one another 

[01:14:05] and we have to move to an ecological framework 

[01:14:08] speaking. And some of that war is intentional. When did you want to jump in. Okay. Um, thank you. The problem partly is, or the problem is made worse by the fact that some of the players in the political sphere have realized that by exacerbating those differences and pitting groups against each other, they can actually at least lock things up and maybe even win lots of power.

[01:14:31] And we're in the middle of that, which is keeping us from the already challenging and difficult sets of collaborations that we're talking about as necessary. So it's messy. If I could 

[01:14:42] quickly respond to that, one of the challenges is how can we deconstruct the dark side of megalomania sociopath in narcissism?

[01:14:50] That's the 

[01:14:50] dark side. That sounded like a simple question to answer. 

[01:14:55] Well, that's why you ask evocative questions. You have to ask the evocative questions to get people to focus on what matters. And if you don't deconstruct the old and reconstruct the new simultaneously, it ain't going to happen. 

[01:15:08] I'm with you.

[01:15:09] I'm with you, Mr. Carmichael. 

[01:15:12] Okay. As I listen, there's a great stress and the conversation on changing the attitudes of individual people. I think that that's a bit of a stake. The agency that we're coping with right now with climate is institutional, not individuals. And we've got to find a way to take on the big oil companies.

[01:15:33] We're not looking for that. We could change everybody's opinion and it wouldn't make any difference. I want to add, uh, if we fail at cop 22, is that an opportunity or does that 

[01:15:46] really set us cop 26? I think you mean the one that's coming up, the one that's just started. Um, yeah. I'm, I'm not even sure what fail means in this case.

[01:15:54] Uh, I mean, other than not coming up with an agreement or something, but yeah, th there's a lot on the table right now. Um, Lyft. 

[01:16:04] Yeah. Uh, I think, uh, I really appreciate this conversation and it's getting rich, rich. Um, I wanted to add two small stories and learned. We started many years ago with the students, a group called venture lab, and the venture lab was with young students, um, given free or idle capital of the university search system of learned.

[01:16:30] And it has been extremely successful. We offered them free of charge during a period of nine months, uh, the possibility to explore and develop and show, uh, or build a narrative in the taxonomy of today. Um, and it is still going on and it's very good. Uh, and I think that the learning there is the, the second part of it, of our venture lab that is, there is so much capital in waiting untapped potential and that untapped potential is very visible in this conversation.

[01:17:08] So therefore we need to bridge it. And then most recent construct and learn is a start up called, uh, Kenya engine. And as you probably have realized in your car, even if it's an electrical car, you have a stock engine. And so we need to develop that start engine for society. And that's what one guy you are investor.

[01:17:36] Then they learn them. And it's really starting to go in a very positive spiral up on, uh, getting people together to, with the new story of the city of LA and the university of Willow and the region of loan and Sweden and the region of the aerosol. So the start engine it concept. 

[01:18:02] Thanks life. If you have a link to that or something like that, that you could share in the chat, I just searched for Scania engine and tells me like what the, what Volvo's new VA is like.

[01:18:11] And I'm like, I don't think that's what we're talking about. You haven't filtered there. Yeah. Stacy. Yeah. 

[01:18:18] So I had been talking to people, expressing my desire to talk about, um, using, to use the language of an attention economy so that I could bring in things like effort and time and weave those values in and yesterday mentioned it to Jerry.

[01:18:35] And he actually said the presence economy. Now, most of you know, those of you that know me, I haven't read a lot of these theories. My learning has come from observations and listening. And so before I sat down to write yesterday, yesterday, I said, I better look up and see what's written about the attention economy and the presence economy.

[01:18:57] So I did that. And what first came up, I think his name was David Jay. There were two charts and it showed the attention economy and the presence economy. And it said the attention economy creates people who the presence economy creates people who, and my first thought probably coming, because I'm not coming from business, which is really most important.

[01:19:20] What I'm trying to say is I was like, wow, we're prioritizing the economy over people. We're looking for an economy to create the people. And that's what has to shift. And to me, that's a result of the culture via what is it called? The culturalization of capitalism, which all these well-meaning people that are trying to come up with something new, they have to recognize their own culturalization.

[01:19:48] So I just wanted to share that. I think that's important. 

[01:19:53] Thank you, Stacy. And can you share, um, David's David J's post in the chat, a fuse.

[01:20:01] Okay. You know what? I bet we can use the big, large Oracle that exists for free on the web to find it. Um, thanks. No worries. That's all right. I think you still have your hand up. 

[01:20:14] Uh, 

[01:20:17] that's great. So we're getting close to the end of our 90 minutes. This has been, um, actually a little fast, even for me. We, we, we sort of glance gave glancing blows to a lot of really important things.

[01:20:29] Um, and I would love to just slow down for the last 10 minutes and reflect on the process. And we had a slightly bumpy road into finding our topic. I think we had a, uh, like a, uh, juicy, useful conversation in the middle of it. I'm really pleased for where we went and all the resources I've been weaving them into my brain as we go.

[01:20:49] And I'll share that back in the Mattermost channel when I post the video and all of that. Uh, but if we could just spend a moment, um, Uh, peach has put a link in the chat, Stacey, if that's the right, uh, if that's the right article will give us a thumbs up, please. Cool. Um, but why don't we just do a little bit of reflecting and debriefing on the, on the process for our last 10 minutes.

[01:21:13] Anybody want to jump in?

[01:21:17] We'll jump in quickly, you know, when you're thinking about changing a big story, I remember Eleanor Austin said the solution to a global problem. It's not a global solution polycentric solution and it's everywhere as 

[01:21:31] a pressure point. Um, and there's something about polycentricity distributed something, distributed, everything, or decentralized everything, um, interdisciplinarity, uh, and then safety that I think the nexus of those things is part of our solution space.

[01:21:52] And unfortunately, a lot of the decentralization effort right now is. Pretty strongly to cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers and the web 3.0 and all of that and the D web. And I, I, I don't have a strong negative feeling about that yet, but I have an instinct that that's not the right kind of solution or is it, or there's a piece of it.

[01:22:14] That's right. And there's a piece of it that's wrong. And I can't peel them apart anyway, that, that that's, that's sitting as a, as a question that came up during our process, for me, other reflections on our, on our process. And by the way, doc Searls a friend of ours has a residency at Ostrom's workshop right now.

[01:22:32] They've, they've rented a flat in, uh, in Bloomington. And, uh, he gave a seminar, uh, as Eric mentioned earlier this week, uh, that was a lot about his initiatives and kind of the intention casting and, and a bunch of other things like that. But there, you know, we could sort of easily, easily connect in there and see how to be helpful or what to do other thoughts on this conversation.

[01:22:59] This was a perfect conversation for everybody. No, come on. 

[01:23:04] Well, we didn't, we didn't exactly select a topic like we threatened to do at the start of 

[01:23:07] the call. Well, I felt like we narrowed down on when Wendy posed the sentence and put it in the chat that I was focused on that. And I was hoping that that was kind of a gentle focus for all of us, but it, and it, and we didn't manage to synthesize everything, uh, perfectly, but, uh, they were pretty well.

[01:23:24] Um, for me, I don't know. Uh, if, if someone wanted to propose another way to do picking a topic on the alternate weeks is beyond the test. Yes, totally. There's going to be a quiz afterwards. Um, 

[01:23:38] there's a quiz in a month. 

[01:23:39] You have to remember it. Yeah. And I exactly Anita recall the topic was selecting a topic.

[01:23:47] There was a piece, there was a piece of that at the beginning. And if somebody wants to recommend a better algorithm for topic selection, that I'd be up for that too. Um, and I, my habit for a lot of calls is merely to pick a topic from like an errand, because I'm like, this sounds like an interesting thing and let's see who shows up.

[01:24:03] So that's my Mo typically, Doug, 

[01:24:06] what happened in the process? I think we started out as people putting in ideas for things to talk about, then the speeches would get longer and longer, and we never got to the things that probably half the people that group would have long to talk 

[01:24:20] about. Um, can you name one?

[01:24:24] Well, what to do about the fact that we're failing with climate 

[01:24:29] change? Well, I feel like we addressed that in some interesting ways. I don't feel like we, I don't feel like we were skirting that topic. 

[01:24:35] No, I don't think I didn't feel skirted, but I think other people did. 

[01:24:39] Okay. Um, anyone who did, I'm just trying to like, get a sense of, of where we just missing the point entirely.

[01:24:47] Yeah, I, I maybe have a 

[01:24:48] slightly, I think, I think it was touched on, but it may not have been to the satisfaction for Doug. So I think, you know, people will take different pieces, but this issue of topic, one thing that I just put a question in and Ron, think of a topic is to frame it as evocative questions where people can co-create and decide collectively what is the question that we want to focus on for this discussion and even spend some time mulling over that question, then focusing on that question and, uh, doing it, honing in, do a deep dive.

[01:25:17] This was sort of like more of a lateral thing, but if we want to, you know, and the pros and cons between horizontal and vertical approaches, but I can understand why Doug might've been frustrated because we didn't go deep enough 

[01:25:30] into the yeah. And we're, we're 90 minutes and we're all kind of scattered here.

[01:25:34] And, uh, and, and. We sort of went into none of these topics in enough depth for me, because I would love to be able, I just need a time multiply fractal time multiplying device, because I want to pause and go, oh, Rick, the stuff that you're doing, you know, or Sam, the stuff that he's doing in local food economy, food systems, what does that like and how to unpack it and how that relates to the stuff Kevin's been doing, uh, with local neighborhoods and as he thinks, and I mean, every one of these is practically interesting.

[01:26:03] Um, and the only way we're going to sort of lined up solving this as kind of a, in a distributed collaborative way where we share in what we learn and how we figured out Wendy.

[01:26:15] So what's interesting for me about this conversation and listening to all of you, um, reflect on it too, is, um, is, is having conversations like this. I think you're unique and special in the sense that. It's some, it's a topic that touches on I'm guessing touches on everything that we're all working on.

[01:26:38] And for me, the takeaway is that I'm going to, as I start working on more of my project, it's a reminder of to keep your, to keep yearning and stretching and reaching for that new narrative, that's going to ripple and affect everyone else. So that's kind of the takeaway I take from this, which has incredible value because there's very few places to have these conversations, getting, you know, setting aside time to talk about climate change is a hornet's nest in and of itself.

[01:27:10] And for me to, to, to kind of. Come at it from a different angle like we did today is super valuable. And my ultimate goal and the projects that I'm working on is to really is to start to create an interface that we can see these varying perspectives and how they interlink with each other. Right. So we might say that today's perspective was maybe more philosophical or, um, social psychology or even, you know, psychology.

[01:27:38] And, and, and that has a place in the narrative of when we're building, you know, new economies and new right. But has a place in all these other things. And I think that's one of the rich, rich, um, um, fields of, of, of gems that we pull from, um, from coming together like this as a community, is that, you know, I, I enjoy the conversations when we get deep into tech, because there's usually some gem in there for me.

[01:28:03] And I enjoy these conversations too. And I think these happen a little less often, and I really appreciate them when they do. 

[01:28:09] Thank you. That was lovely. Um, Rick then left and then we're close to our end of our calls. Yeah, very 

[01:28:18] quickly. I just wanted to, to emphasize something you just said jury, which is there's, there is a diversity here, but how can we in some, on some occasions go up to the metal level and look at what are the questions that are generic across domains that are generalizable 

[01:28:34] and how can we, um, ask 

[01:28:36] questions that people want to speak to?

[01:28:39] And I think that's a difficult thing to set the agenda and it may need some work between these sessions to say, which is, if you decide to do this, what's the question of the week. So the students, um, that people can have input into 

[01:28:52] rather 

[01:28:52] than just one person, uh, setting the agenda . 

[01:28:57] Yeah. Thank you. And, and, uh, it would be very interesting to take the Mattermost channel for these calls, which is ODM calls and have a process.

[01:29:06] That by two weeks from now, because next week we'll do a regular check-in rhythm. So we would have two weeks to sit and pick and sort of refine a really nice focus question for the next call like this. That would be a, it'd be totally up for that. So, um, uh, we'll put a link to that channel in the, in the zoom chat right now, so everybody can be on it, but that might be a really thing, a really nice thing to test for next, uh, next call like this, which is two weeks from today.

[01:29:31] Uh, and then I'd like to read a poem for, to take us out. So, 

[01:29:36] uh, um, I wanted to add to the conversation, the roadmap from, uh, professor Nonaka in Japan, it's called second model, have a look at the second model and that might be a topic for the next conversation it's multidimensional. And it's also taking us up to the next level of conversation.

[01:29:59] So that is in Japan, uh, a kind of roadmap for society, 5.0. 

[01:30:06] Um, and I, I, I left the tab open with Nonaka psyche, cause I have no knock. I remember him, but not his second model. So we will find that out and share that. Um, thank you. And, and just by way, we're, we're at the half, but, um, I subscribed to a poem of the day from the poetry foundation.

[01:30:22] And this morning, this poem, uh, kind of stopped me a little bit. Uh, so I want to, um, read it for us and I'll share the link to it. Uh, let me get rid of the stuff after the question, mark. And I'll post the link in the chat and then I'll read the poem is titled the United States welcomes you by Tracy K Smith.

[01:30:47] Why? And by whose power where you sent, what do you see that you may wish to steal? Why does dancing, why do your dark bodies drink up all the light? What are you demanding that we feel? If you stolen something, then what does that leaping in your chest? What is the nature of your mission? How do you seek, do you seek to offer a confession, have you anything to do with others brought by us to harm, then why are you afraid and why do you invade our Knight hands raised eyes wide nude as ghosts.

[01:31:20] Is there something you wish to confess? Is this some enigmatic type of test? What if we fail, how and to whom do we address our appeal?

[01:31:35] And I just read that and I just was brought to a complete stop or the problem is beautiful. Um, depressing, very, uh, and you know, Hey, that could be a history book right there. Um, Uh, and there's the chat channel. Thank you, Pete. Really appreciate that. Um, and see you all in a week. So next week is going to be normal checking rhythm.

[01:32:00] And the week after that, or back to, uh, whatever topic we were fine in that channel, which I'm down for. Sounds great. Thanks everybody.

[01:32:12] As we used to see on the jungle cruise, our river dirty

[01:32:20] Jerry, how do I save the chat on the sound? Do you know? 

[01:32:25] I just saved it 

[01:32:29] even. Perfect. Thank you for you, buddy.
