# Planning and Plans

[[Topic/Critical Four Letter Words]]: We talked about "hope" and "fear."  We didn't get to "plan."

I think it would be interesting to have a conversation here about plans and planning. This comes up because [[Person/Doug Carmichael]] and a couple of other people have said to me, so where the fuck is the climate plan ([[Topic/Climate Change Responses]])? Why isn't there a plan, just this huge crisis, why isn't there a plan?

And there are actually a lot of plans. There's a conversation to be had about plans and planning. And **how do you plan in a mess**, which is different than planning a project to build things.

**How do you make a map in a storm?**

My friend [[Person/Chauncey Bell]] is fierce about this. He decries the notions of problems and solving.

So **as soon as you say "problem," people think "solution,"** and **solution is fine for discrete problems, but not for messes**... about a Ted Nelson, intertwingled, complex, you know, well, what we're in. Where you cannot find discrete solutions. Everything's connected to everything else.

You've got technical and social and political and you know, many different dimensions, not conducive to neat and tidy plans. [[Persons/Dwight Eisenhower]], not only twice president, but also the architect of the D-Day invasion, is famous for saying that **plans are worthless, but planning is indispensable.**  (See [Plans Are Worthless, But Planning Is Everything](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/) (Quote Investigator).)

[[Person/Mike Tyson]] said, "**Everybody has plans until they get hit for the first time.**"
