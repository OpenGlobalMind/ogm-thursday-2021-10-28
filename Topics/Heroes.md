The hero's journey

 in some respects we have to kill [[/Topic/The Hero's Journey]] and [[Heroes]], because the hero can't save us. It's a complete mythology. How can we shift beyond this to stories of heroicism with the royal we.
 
 A couple of books that came to mind, um, as I was thinking about what I was going to say was how can we create living story and movements based upon the open innovation work of Henry Jasper, and also.

John door's book on measure, what matters, um, because that provides a framework for innovation. How can we scale up the, uh, innovation, capacities and capabilities of ordinary people? Because that's the only way that we're going to scale up something that's going to have any measure of mitigating against the disasters we're going to be facing in the future with climate change.
