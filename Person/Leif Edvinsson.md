# Leif Edvinsson

I can help a little bit by showing you Leif in my Brain. In fact, he was named "Brain Of The Year,"" a few years ago, which is done by the [[Organization/Brain Trust Charity]] in the UK, uh, which is run by, I guess, by [[Person/Tony Buzan]].

Here's the book on national intellectual capital, [[Book/Corporate Longitude]], what you need to know to navigate the knowledge economy, from 2002. He and [[Person/Hank Kune]], and I ([[Person/Jerry Michalski]]) have been collaborating a lot on [[Topic/Positive Cartography]], etc., etc.

He has formed a thing called [[Organization/The New Club of Paris]] (2006), which is doing a bunch of interesting work, which is kind of based on the 1956 [[Organization/Paris Club]], uh, which was worried about renegotiating sovereign debt back in the day.
