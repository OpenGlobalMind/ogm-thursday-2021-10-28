# Ted Nelson

So Ted Nelson would be hypertext? What's my shortcut to Ted, [[/Topic/As We May Think]], right. 

[[/Topic/As We Will Think]] is his version of that essay. 

He's also got [[Book/Computer Lib - Dream Machines]], right? 

I think [[/Book/Possiplex]] is his best, most recent book for anyone looking to study his ideas.
