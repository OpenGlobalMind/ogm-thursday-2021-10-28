# Ted Nelson

So Ted Nelson would be hypertext? What's my shortcut to Ted, [[Topic/As We May Think]], right. 

[[Topic/As We Will Think]] is his version of that essay. 

He's also got [[Book/Computer Lib - Dream Machines]], right? 

I think [[Book/Possiplex]] is his best, most recent book for anyone looking to study his ideas. 

Also see: [[Topic/ZigZag (software)]]

> Theodor Holm Nelson (born June 17, 1937) is an American pioneer of information technology, philosopher, and sociologist. He coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia in 1963 and published them in 1965. Nelson coined the terms transclusion, virtuality, and intertwingularity (in Literary Machines). According to a 1997 Forbes profile, Nelson "sees himself as a literary romantic, like a Cyrano de Bergerac, or 'the Orson Welles of software'."
