# The Dawn of Everything

Title: The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity

Authors: [[Person/David Graeber]], [[Person/David Wengrow]]

I've been reading David Graber's new book, The Dawn of Everything, which is stunning and deeply important. Um, one reviewer compared it to Galileo and Darwin, which I think is not a huge overreach.

Giulio Ongaro, Jacobin:

> An instant classic . . . Fatalistic sentiments about human nature melt away upon turning the pages . . . [The Dawn of Everything] sits in a different class to all the other volumes on world history we are accustomed to reading . . . If comparisons must be made, they should be made with works of similar caliber in other fields, most credibly, I venture, with the works of Galileo or Darwin. Graeber and Wengrow do to human history what the first two did to astronomy and biology respectively.
